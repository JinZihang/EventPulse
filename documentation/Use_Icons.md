# Use Icons

Currently, the project uses [React Native Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons). It has been fully setup for Android, partially setup for iOS.
Currently, for iOS development, the icon packages you can use directly are:

- [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons)

If you want to use other icon packages from React Native Vector Icons, open the `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode, select the project, go to `Info`, then add the `.tff` font package you want to use under `Fonts provided by application`. Afterwards, update this file regarding the directly usable font packages.
